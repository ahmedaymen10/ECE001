<h1> Disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence  </h1>
<ul>
<li>High Cost: The hardware and software requirement of AI is very costly as it requires lots of maintenance to meet current world requirements.</li>
<li>Can't think out of the box: Even we are making smarter machines with AI, but still they cannot work out of the box, as the robot will only do that work for which they are trained, or programmed.</li>
<li>No feelings and emotions: AI machines can be an outstanding performer, but still it does not have the feeling so it cannot make any kind of emotional attachment with human, and may sometime be harmful for users if the proper care is not taken.</li>
<li>Increase dependency on machines: With the increment of technology, people are getting more dependent on devices and hence they are losing their mental capabilities.</li>
<li>No Original Creativity: As humans are so creative and can imagine some new ideas but still AI machines cannot beat this power of human intelligence and cannot be creative and imaginative.</li>
